                            If a guest would like to say a quick few words during the speech time, a request must be made at least two weeks before the wedding so we can allocate an appropriate timeline for the wedding program. Please understand that although we welcome words, we ask these to be no more than a minute long. NO PERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED.

                            During the wedding ceremony and the speeches before dinner, there will be NO PHONES or PERSONAL DEVICES OUT! All devices must be on Silent and put away during these times.

                            We are having a Modern, Nontraditional, and Non-religious wedding, skipping many traditional wedding customs. We ask that everyone who attends respects our choices regarding what/which customs we decide to include.

                            We are inviting many people from our social/family circles. We understand that not everyone in our social/family circle is within yours and that not everyone may be a fan of everyone else. However, we expect that if you choose to attend, regardless of who else attends, the focus will be on the wedding and celebrating us officially tying the knot.

                            Underage drinking will not be ACCEPTED or TOLERATED! We have an unlimited non-alcoholic package. The unlimited non-alcoholic package includes things such as non-alcoholic cider, tea, and coffee. There are no excuses. If anyone is seen bending this, they will be asked to leave. This includes handing someone underage a drink. The venue is very strict about this and could kick us out if it occurs.
